		"abstract": "The goal of object categorization is to locate and identify instances of an object category within an image. Recognizing an object in an image is difﬁcult when images include occlusion, poor quality, noise or background clutter, and this task becomes even more challenging when many objects are present in the same scene. Several models for object categorization use appearance and context information from objects to improve recognition accuracy. Appearance information, based on visual cues, can successfully identify object classes up to a certain extent. Context information, based on the interaction among objects in the scene or global scene statistics, can help successfully disambiguate appearance inputs in recognition tasks. In this work we address the problem of incorporating different types of contextual information for robust object categorization in computer vision. We review different ways of using contextual information in the ﬁeld of object categorization, considering the most common levels of extraction of context and the different levels of contextual interactions. We also examine common machine learning models that integrate context information into object recognition frameworks and discuss scalability, optimizations and possible future approaches.",

		"abstract": "Recent discoveries in automated planning are broadening the scope of planners, from toy problems to real applications. However, applying automated planners to real-world problems is far from simple. On the one hand, the deﬁnition of accurate action models for planning is still a bottleneck. On the other hand, off-the-shelf planners fail to scale up and to provide good solutions in many domains. In these problematic domains, planners can exploit domain-speciﬁc control knowledge to improve their performance in terms of both speed and quality of the solutions. However, manual deﬁnition of control knowledge is quite difﬁcult. This paper reviews recent techniques in machine learning for the automatic deﬁnition of planning knowledge. It has been organized according to the target of the learning process: automatic deﬁnition of planning action models and automatic deﬁnition of planning control knowledge. In addition, the paper reviews the advances in the related ﬁeld of reinforcement learning.",

		"abstract": "Multi-armed bandit problems are the most basic examples of sequential decision problems with an exploration–exploitation trade-oﬀ. This is the balance between staying with the option that gave highest payoﬀs in the past and exploring new options that might give higher payoﬀs in the future. Although the study of bandit problems dates back to the 1930s, exploration–exploitation trade-oﬀs arise in several modern applications, such as ad placement, website optimization, and packet routing. Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is deﬁned by the payoﬀ process associated with each option. In this monograph, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis of regret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoﬀs and adversarial payoﬀs. Besides the basic setting of ﬁnitely many actions, we also analyze some of the most important variants and extensions, such as the contextual bandit model.",

		"abstract": "Kernel methods are among the most popular techniques in machine learning. From a regularization perspective they play a central role in regularization theory as they provide a natural choice for the hypotheses space and the regularization functional through the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. From a probabilistic perspective they are the key in the context of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function is known as the covariance function. Traditionally, kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problem with scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs, motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning. In this paper, we review different methods to design or learn valid kernel functions for multiple outputs, paying particular attention to the connection between probabilistic and functional methods.",

Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classiﬁcation and graphical modeling, combining the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classiﬁcation methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This tutorial describes conditional random ﬁelds, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this tutorial is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of ﬁelds.",

		"abstract": "Randomized algorithms for very large matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years. Much of this work was motivated by problems in large-scale data analysis, largely since matrices are popular structures with which to model data drawn from a wide range of application domains, and this work was performed by individuals from many diﬀerent research communities. While the most obvious beneﬁt of randomization is that it can lead to faster algorithms, either in worst-case asymptotic theory and/or numerical implementation, there are numerous other beneﬁts that are at least as important. For example, the use of randomization can lead to simpler algorithms that are easier to analyze or reason about when applied in counterintuitive settings; it can lead to algorithms with more interpretable output, which is of interest in applications where analyst time rather than just computational time is of interest; it can lead implicitly to regularization and more robust output; and randomized algorithms can often be organized to exploit modern computational architectures better than classical numerical methods.",

		"abstract": "The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although speciﬁc domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and joint training of deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep architectures. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.",

There are two common intuitions about how this learning process should be organized: (i) by choosing query points that shrink the space of candidate classiﬁers as rapidly as possible; and (ii) by exploiting natural clusters in the (unlabeled) data set. Recent research has yielded learning algorithms for both paradigms that are eﬃcient, work with generic hypothesis classes, and have rigorously characterized labeling requirements.

Moreover time series data, which is characterized by its numerical and continuous nature, is always considered as a whole instead of individual numerical ﬁeld. The increasing use of time series data has initiated a great deal of research and development attempts in the ﬁeld of data mining. The abundant research on time series data mining in the last decade could hamper the entry of interested researchers, due to its complexity. In this paper, a comprehensive revision on the existing time series data mining research is given. They are generally categorized into representation and indexing, similarity measure, segmentation, visualization and mining. Moreover state-of-the-art research issues are also highlighted. The primary objective of this paper is to serve as a glossary for interested researchers to have an overall picture on the current time series data mining development and identify their potential research direction to further investigation.",

		"abstract": "Studying the inherently high-dimensional nature of the data in a lower dimensional manifold has become common in recent years. This is generally known as dimensionality reduction. A very interesting strategy for dimensionality reduction is what is known as subspace analysis. Beginning with the Eigenface method, face recognition and in general computer vision has witnessed a growing interest in algorithms that capitalize on this idea and an ample number of such efﬁcient algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms mainly differ in the kind of projection method used (linear or non-linear) or in the criterion employed for classiﬁcation. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive performance evaluation of about twenty ﬁve different subspace algorithms under several important real time test conditions. For this purpose, we have considered the performance of these algorithms on data taken from four standard face and object databases namely ORL, Yale, FERET and the COIL-20 object database. This paper also presents some theoretical aspects of the algorithm and the analysis of the simulations carried out.",

		"abstract": "The game of poker has been identiﬁed as a beneﬁcial domain for current AI research because of the properties it possesses such as the need to deal with hidden information and stochasticity. The identiﬁcation of poker as a useful research domain has inevitably resulted in increased attention from academic researchers who have pursued many separate avenues of research in the area of computer poker. The poker domain has often featured in previous review papers that focus on games in general, however a comprehensive review paper with a speciﬁc focus on computer poker has so far been lacking in the literature. In this paper, we present a review of recent algorithms and approaches in the area of computer poker, along with a survey of the autonomous poker agents that have resulted from this research. We begin with the ﬁrst serious attempts to create strong computerised poker players by constructing knowledge-based and simulation-based systems. This is followed by the use of computational game theory to construct robust poker agents and the advances that have been made in this area. Approaches to constructing exploitive agents are reviewed and the challenging problems of creating accurate and dynamic opponent models are addressed. Finally, we conclude with a selection of alternative approaches that have received attention in previously published material and the interesting problems that they pose.",

At the core of this new wave of research is the use of computational tools that play critical roles not only in directing the selection of key experiments, but also in formulating new testable hypotheses through detailed analysis of complex genomic information that is not achievable using traditional approaches alone. Epigenomics, which combines traditional genomics with computer science, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry and proteomics for the large-scale analysis of heritable changes in phenotype, gene function or gene expression that are not dependent on gene sequence, offers new opportunities to further our understanding of transcriptional regulation, nuclear organization, development and disease. This article examines existing computational strategies for the study of epigenetic factors. The most important databases and bioinformatic tools in this rapidly growing field have been reviewed.",

		"abstract": "A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.",

		"abstract": "Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientiﬁc classiﬁcation puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identiﬁers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classiﬁcation or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to ﬁnd structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientiﬁc ﬁelds. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was ﬁrst published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difﬁculty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering.",

		"abstract": "The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i. e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e. g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.",

		"abstract": "Pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision, with several applications that have the potential to positively impact quality of life. In recent years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has grown steadily. However, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols are used, making direct comparisons difficult. To address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. We make three primary contributions: 1) We put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. Our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. Our experiments show that despite significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement.
